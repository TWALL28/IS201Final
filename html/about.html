                        <h3> Learn a Few things About me</h3>
                        <p> I was born and raised in Arlington, Virginia. Growing up I was an avid baseball and basketball player. My first Year playing football was my freshman year of high school. Upon graduating high school, I served a mission in Macei√≥, Brazil.</p>
                        <p> I love to ski, golf, and spend time at the lake when I am not playing football. I love exploring the mountains of Utah in my Jeep and finding places that I think nobody else has ever been before. I love country music but also enjoy just about every genre. I will probably beat you at bowling, ping pong, or cornhole. I'm also down for a game of chess if you're feeling really prestige.</p>
                        <p> I am currently a sophomore at Brigham Young University, hoping to study finance in the Marriot School of Business. I am applying to the program this June, and I am confident that I will be admitted. I hope you can take a look at my resume below or follow the link to my LinkedIn page at the bottom of the page.</p>
